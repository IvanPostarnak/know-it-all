* separated GET requests (3 starting GET request instead of 1 united)
* no 'deleting' or 'changing' options
* not using 'try-catch' blocks
* user's categories are not supported right now
* 'filtering' works with 'trashbox'-hidden container and 'append' method

## architecture
![color-input-achitecture](assets/src/assets/img/know-it-all-7.jpg)

* classic architecture (= no architecture at all)
* database as JSON files (which is not comming handy)
* modules are not separated fully (red arrows)
* server is not separated into modules

*Mostly, system IS NOT scalable*
